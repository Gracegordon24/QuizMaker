# QuizMaker
Created Spring 2022
A project I had to create in college for a semester final. This is a quiz maker. It uses java programming language and data structures techniques. Organization of the project was using the data structure (mine consist of stacks and ques) and pulled data from files. Then when comparing the user input with the file being scanned it is then verified. Also consisted of multiple of files to be scanned and compared to user input and then created a file for the user with it's grade.
