# QuizMaker
A project I had to create in college for a semester final. This is a quiz maker. It uses java and data structures techniques. Organization of the project was using the data structure ( I did stacks and ques) and pulled data from the files. Then when comparing the user input with the file being scanned it is then verified. Also consisted of multiple of files to be scanned and compared to user input and then created a file for the user with it's grade.
